\chapter{Stress-responsive intragenic transcription}
\label{chapter:stress}

\section{Abstract}

Intragenic transcription opens up interesting possibilities for gene regulation in wild-type cells, and individual cases of intragenic transcription have previously been shown to be important for different biological processes.
To discover uncharacterized instances of intragenic transcription, we applied high resolution genomic assays of transcription initiation to wild-type \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} cells in three stress conditions.
Focusing on the condition of oxidative stress, we characterize the expression and chromatin state of oxidative-stress-induced intragenic transcripts, and show that many of these transcripts are likely translated.
Finally, we show that the expression of an oxidative-stress-induced intragenic transcript at the gene \textit{DSK2} is needed for survival in conditions of oxidative stress.

\section{Functions of intragenic transcription in wild-type cells}

In chapters \ref{chapter:six} and \ref{chapter:five}, we presented examples in which mutation of certain transcription elongation factors leads to the expression of intragenic transcripts, i.e., transcripts initiating from within gene bodies.
This implies that wild-type cells have evolved to prevent the occurrence of spurious intragenic transcription.
Despite this, our studies and others \citep{malabat2015, pelechano2013} consistently detect some instances of intragenic transcription in wild-type cells, some of which could have biological functions.
% Intragenic transcription overlaps genic transcription, by definition, making it plausible that the function of an instance of intragenic transcription could be to regulate genic expression, in addition to possible functions that are independent of genic transcription.

One mechanism by which intragenic transcription can exert a function is by being translated into a functional polypeptide or protein.
Translation of a sense strand intragenic transcript is likely to lead to production of an N-terminally truncated protein, which may differ from the full-length protein in stability, subcellular localization, or function due to the absence of domains normally found in the full-length protein \citep{benanti2009, gammie1999, mcknight2014}.
N-terminally truncated proteins can even exert dominant negative effects: Under DNA replication stress, intragenic transcription of the \textit{S. cerevisiae} mitotic spindle microtubule bundling gene \textit{Ase1} leads to the expression of an Ase1 protein lacking an N-terminal dimerization domain \citep{mcknight2014}.
The intragenic Ase1 protein still possesses the normal C-terminal microtubule-binding domain, and evidence suggests that by binding microtubules but not dimerizing, intragenic Ase1 antagonizes the function of full-length Ase1.
This interaction is important for the cellular response to replicative stress.

In other cases, the process of intragenic transcription may be functionally important, rather than the product of intragenic transcription.
As transcription occurs, co-transcriptional processses including chromatin remodeling and histone modification also take place via the recruitment of various factors to the transcription complex.
These factors are often recruited in a manner dependent on the stage of transcription, which results in stereotypic patterns of chromatin state over transcribed regions.
For example, in \textit{S. cerevisiae}, the Set1 complex responsible for methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is recruited to Pol II specifically during early elongation, resulting in a pattern where H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is primarily found over the first 500 base pairs of transcribed regions.
Since intragenic transcribed regions overlap genic transcribed regions, intragenic transcription has the potential to generate unususal patterns of nucleosome positioning and histone modification over a gene, which may influence expression from the genic promoter.
This occurs at the \textit{S. cerevisiae} asparagine catabolic gene \textit{ASP3}, where sense strand intragenic transcription is necessary for wild-type levels of H3K4me3 over the 5$^\prime$-end of the gene and full induction of the gene upon nitrogen stress \citep{huang2010}.
For other genes, antisense intragenic transcription leaves the H3K4me2 mark over the genic promoters of genes, modulating the kinetics of genic expression in response to environmental changes \citep{kim2012}.

\end{wrapfigure}

To discover cases of stress-induced intragenic transcription initiation, we performed ChIP-nexus of TFIIB for wild-type yeast under conditions of oxidative stress, amino acid stress, and nitrogen stress, along with controls of growth in rich YPD medium and defined SC medium.
The genic TFIIB response to each of the stresses either correlates well with the expected transcriptomic response to the stress (Figure \ref{fig:stress_gasch_comparison}), or is enriched for metabolic pathways consistent with the cellular response to the stress (Figure \ref{fig:stress_nitrogen_gene_ontology}), confirming that TFIIB ChIP-nexus captures changes in transcription initiation and that the cells were stressed as intended.
In total, we identify 140 intragenic TFIIB peaks significantly induced at least 1.5-fold in at least one stress condition, with some peaks being induced in more than one stress (Figures \ref{fig:stress_tfiib_coverage}, \ref{fig:stress_tfiib_ridgelines}).
We also observe a slight negative correlation between stress-induced changes in intragenic TFIIB signal and changes in the corresponding genic TFIIB signal (Figure \ref{fig:stress_genic_vs_intra}).

\end{SCfigure}

Because the greatest changes to intragenic transcription initiation were detected in oxidative stress, we focused on this condition and performed TSS-seq to determine which intragenic initiation events produce stable RNAs and in which strand orientation these events occur.
Considering only TSS peaks with a TFIIB peak overlapping the window extending 200 base pairs upstream of the TSS summit, we find cases of both sense intragenic and antisense TSSs that are differentially expressed in oxidative stress (Figure \ref{fig:stress_promoter_tss_diffexp_summary}).
In general, the induced intragenic TSSs we detect are expressed at lower levels than induced genic TSSs: The most abundant induced intragenic TSS is present in oxidative stress at levels comparable to the 54\textsuperscript{th} percentile of induced genic TSS abundances (Figure \ref{fig:stress_promoter_tss_expression}).

\section{Polysome enrichment of oxidative-stress-induced intragenic transcripts}

Translation of a transcript requires that the transcript possess both a 5$^\prime$-cap and a poly-A tail.
Since the TSS-seq protocol enriches for both of these features, this implies that the oxidative-stress-dependent intragenic transcripts we detect by TSS-seq could potentially be translated.
For sense strand intragenic transcripts, this could generate N-terminally-truncated protein isoforms.
To see how likely oxidative-stress-dependent intragenic transcripts are to be targets for translation, we performed sucrose gradient fractionation, isolated the RNA from the fractions containing polysomes, and sequenced TSS-seq libraries of the polysome-associated RNA.
Among oxidative-stress-induced TSSs with corresponding TFIIB peaks, intragenic TSSs in oxidative stress are less somewhat less enriched in the polysome fraction compared to genic TSSs (Figure \ref{fig:stress_promoter_tss_polyenrichment}).
However, half of the induced intragenic TSSs are found in polysomes during oxidative stress at levels above the 25\textsuperscript{th} percentile of induced genic TSS levels in polysomes, indicating that many of the intragenic transcripts we identify are translated at some level.

\end{figure}

\section{Functions of intragenic DSK2 expression in oxidative stress}

To investigate a particular case of oxidative-stress-induced intragenic transcription in more depth, we focused on the gene \textit{DSK2}, which is associated with the intragenic TSS we found to be most significantly induced upon oxidative stress.
The major \textit{DSK2} intragenic TSS is associated with a TFIIB peak that is similarly induced in oxidative stress (Figure \ref{fig:stress_dsk2_summary}), and the intragenic transcript is also found in polysomes at intermediate levels (Figure \ref{fig:stress_promoter_tss_polyenrichment}).
Using a published dataset of histone modification MNase-ChIP-seq data during a timecourse of oxidative stress \citep{weiner2015}, we see that induction of intragenic \textit{DSK2} expression corresponds with shifts in transcription-associated histone modifications over the \textit{DSK2} gene, such as a spreading of H3K4me3 from the 5$^\prime$ end of the gene towards the 3$^\prime$ end (Figure \ref{fig:stress_dsk2_summary}).
\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=6in]{figures/stress/stress_dsk2_summary.pdf}
    \caption[Sense TSS-seq signal, TFIIB ChIP-nexus protection, and MNase-ChIP-seq data at the \textit{DSK2} gene, over an oxidative stress timecourse.]{Sense TSS-seq signal (purple), TFIIB ChIP-nexus protection (grey), smoothed MNase-seq dyad signal, and relative H3K4me3 MNase-ChIP-seq enrichment over the gene \textit{DSK2}, over a timecourse of oxidative stress.

The shaded bars on the \textit{DSK2} ORF indicate PACE-core elements on the sense (darker) or antisense (lighter) strands, which are potential binding sites for the transcription factor Rpn4 \citep{shirozu2015}. The lightly shaded region of the background indicates the boundaries of the intragenic TFIIB peak.}
    \label{fig:stress_dsk2_summary}
\end{figure}

\begin{wrapfigure}[10]{r}{3in}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/stress/stress_dsk2_pace_northern.pdf}
    \caption[Northern blot for \textit{DSK2} transcripts in wild-type \textit{DSK2} and \textit{dsk2-pace} strains, in the absence or presence of oxidative stress.]{Northern blot for \textit{DSK2} transcripts in wild-type \textit{DSK2} and \textit{dsk2-pace} strains, in the absence or presence of oxidative stress induced by addition of diamide to the media.}
    \label{fig:stress_dsk2_pace_northern}
\end{wrapfigure}

Dsk2 is a member of a family of partially redundant ubiquitin receptors that shuttle polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation.
Upon inspection of the \textit{DSK2} DNA sequence, we discovered multiple PACE-core sequences within the \textit{DSK2} coding sequence, which are potential binding sites for the proteasome transcription factor Rpn4 \citep{shirozu2015}.
By making silent mutations to three PACE-core elements occurring just upstream of the \textit{DSK2} intragenic TFIIB peak (the more darkly shaded sense strand PACE-core elements in Figure \ref{fig:stress_dsk2_summary}, two of which are adjacent to each other), we generated a strain named \textit{dsk2-pace} in which intragenic \textit{DSK2} expression is eliminated (Figure \ref{fig:stress_dsk2_pace_northern}).
Full length \textit{DSK2} transcript levels in diamide are not noticeably affected in the \textit{dsk2-pace} mutant, suggesting that intragenic \textit{DSK2} transcription does not affect genic \textit{DSK2} transcript levels.
So far, our efforts to detect a possible intragenic Dsk2 protein have been inconclusive; If intragenic Dsk2 protein is produced, it may be highly unstable.

To test whether intragenic \textit{DSK2} expression is important for the cellular response to oxidative stress, we performed competitive growth experiments in which wild-type \textit{DSK2} and \textit{dsk2-pace} cells, distinguishable by expression of different fluorophores, were co-cultured during a timecourse of oxidative stress induced by addition of diamide to the media.
In these experiments, both strains contained deletions of \textit{RAD23}, another ubiquitin receptor that is partially redundant with \textit{DSK2}.
At diamide concentrations around ~0.9-1.0 mM, we observe that \textit{dsk2-pace} cells begin to grow more slowly than wild-type \textit{DSK2} cells (Figure \ref{fig:stress_diamide_fitnesscomp}).
After two days in 1.25 mM diamide, \textit{dsk2-pace} cells make up less than 2\% of the co-culture, indicating that intragenic \textit{DSK2} expression does play some role in the response to oxidative stress.

\section{TSS-seq analysis of oxidative stress in \textit{Saccharomyces sensu stricto} species}

If an instance of intragenic transcription like that at \textit{DSK2} is functional, then it might be conserved between different species.
To see if this is likely for the cases of oxidative-stress-dependent intragenic transcription we observe in \textit{S. cerevisiae}, we performed TSS-seq in oxidative stress for the related \textit{Saccharomyces sensu stricto} species \textit{Saccharomyces mikatae} and \textit{Saccharomyces uvarum}.
We then performed a multiple genome alignment of the three species, and determined which TSS peaks in \textit{cerevisiae} have corresponding TSSs called in the homologous region of the other species.
By TSS-seq, we do not find evidence of conservation for most oxidative-stress-dependent intragenic TSSs: Out of 39 differentially expressed intragenic \textit{cerevisiae} TSSs with matching TFIIB peaks, we find matching TSSs for only 5 TSSs in \textit{mikatae} (13\%) and 4 TSSs in \textit{uvarum} (10\%), compared to 42\% and 38\% of differentially expressed genic TSSs (Figure \ref{fig:stress_interyeast_intragenic}).

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Yeast growth conditions}

\subsection{Genome builds}

The genome build used for \textit{S. cerevisiae} was R64-2-1 \citep{engel2014}, and the genome build used for \textit{S. pombe} spike-ins was ASM294v2 \citep{wood2002}.
For \textit{S. mikatae} and \textit{S. uvarum}, ultra-scaffold sequences from \citet{scannell11} were used as genomes.

\subsection{TFIIB ChIP-nexus data analysis}

TFIIB ChIP-nexus data analyses were carried out as described in section \ref{subsec:chipnexus}.

\subsection{TSS-seq data analysis}

TSS-seq data analyses were carried out as describd in section \ref{subsec:tss_seq}, except using the relevant genomes for \textit{S. mikatae} and \textit{S. bayanus} libraries.

For \textit{S. mikatae} and \textit{S. bayanus}, annotation of the 5$^\prime$ ends of transcripts was performed as described in section \ref{subsubsec:tss_reannotation}, using ORF annotation GFFs from \citet{scannell11} as both transcript and ORF annotations, and two replicates of unstressed wild-type TSS-seq data.
The 5$^\prime$ end of an annotation was adjusted if it was above the 90\textsuperscript{th} (\textit{S. mikatae}) or 85\textsuperscript{th} (\textit{S. uvarum}) percentile of all non-zero TSS-seq signal.

\subsection{Sucrose gradient fractionation}

\subsection{Polysome RNA TSS-seq analysis}

Polysome RNA TSS-seq libraries were processed in the same manner as total RNA TSS-seq libraries, except no spike-in normalization was performed because no spike-in was included.
A separate Snakemake pipeline was used to integrate data from total RNA and polysome RNA TSS-seq.
This pipeline performs three differential expression analyses using DESeq2 \citep{love2014}: Two analyses compare polysome RNA to total RNA in either the experimental condition (i.e., oxidative stress) or the control condition (i.e., YPD) in order to estimate relative polysome enrichment, $\log_2 \frac{\text{polysome RNA}}{\text{total RNA}}$.
Polysome enrichment is a relative measure of how much more or less polysome RNA is detected than is expected, given the amount of total RNA detected.
The third differential expression analysis tests whether polysome enrichment changes between the control condition and the experimental condition, i.e. whether the experimental perturbation caused changes to the relative association of a transcript with polysomes.
The pipeline also finds all potential ORFs downstream of intragenic TSSs.

\subsection{MNase-ChIP-seq data analysis}

FASTQ files of the MNase-ChIP-seq data from \citet{weiner2015} were obtained from SRA (\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP048526}{SRP048526}), encompassing 201 libraries for ChIP of 26 histone modifications over 6 timepoints with inputs (i.e., MNase-seq libraries).
A Snakemake pipeline was created to process this data.
Reads were cleaned by 3$^\prime$ quality trimming and adapter removal using cutadapt \citep{martin2011}.
Reads were aligned to the \textit{S. cerevisiae} genome using Bowtie 2 \citep{langmead2012}, and uniquely mapping alignments were selected using SAMtools \citep{li2009}.
The median fragment size estimated by MACS2 \citep{zhang2008} over all samples was used to generate coverage of factor protection and fragment midpoints, by extending reads to the fragment size, or by shifting reads by half the fragment size, respectively.
Smoothed nucleosome dyad coverage was generated by smoothing fragment midpoint coverage with a Gaussian kernel of 20 bp bandwidth.
Coverage was normalized to the total number of reads uniquely mapping to the genome.
Relative enrichment of histone modifications was calculated as a normalized log ratio of IP coverage over input (MNase-seq) coverage.

\subsection{Multiple genome alignment}

A Snakemake pipeline was created which uses progressiveMauve \citep{darling2010} to perform multiple genome alignment.
The multiple genome alignment is used to translate annotations such as TSSs called in one species to homologous coordinates in another species, and to extract and visualize data coverage over homologous regions in multiple species.

A separate Snakemake pipeline was created to find homologous TSSs between the three species by looking for overlap between \textit{S. cerevisiae} TSS peaks and peaks called in the other species which were translated into \textit{S. cerevisiae} coordinates.
