	abstract = {Abstract Pervasive transcription has been reported in many eukaryotic organisms, revealing a highly interleaved transcriptome organization that involves thousands of coding and non-coding RNAs. However, to date, the biological impact of transcriptome complexity is still poorly understood. Here I will review how subtle variations of the transcriptome can lead to divergent cellular phenotypes by fine-tuning both its coding potential and regulation. I will discuss strategies that can be used to link molecular variations with divergent biological outcomes. Finally, I will explore the implication of transcriptional complexity for our understanding of gene expression in the context of cell-to-cell phenotypic variability.

Furthermore, transcribed chromatin in the spt6 mutant is hypersensitive to micrococcal nuclease, and this hypersensitivity is suppressed by mutational inactivation of RNA polymerase II. These results suggest that Spt6 plays a critical role in maintaining normal chromatin structure during transcription elongation, thereby repressing transcription initiation from cryptic promoters.

	abstract ={Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are mostly found in multicellular organisms where they recognize phosphotyrosine-containing signaling proteins. Spt6, a conserved transcription factor and putative histone chaperone, contains a C-terminal SH2 domain conserved from yeast to human. In mammals, this SH2 domain recognizes phosphoserines rather than phosphotyrosines and is essential for the recruitment of Spt6 by elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), enabling Spt6 to participate in the coupling of transcription elongation, chromatin modulation, and mRNA export. We have determined the structure of the entire Spt6 C-terminal region from Antonospora locustae, revealing the presence of two highly conserved tandem SH2 domains rather than a single SH2 domain. Although the first SH2 domain has a canonical organization, the second SH2 domain is highly noncanonical and appears to be unique in the SH2 family. However, both SH2 domains have phosphate-binding determinants. Our biochemical and genetic data demonstrate that the complete tandem, but not the individual SH2 domains, are necessary and sufficient for the interaction of Spt6 with RNAPII and are important for Spt6 function in vivo. Furthermore, our data suggest that binding of RNAPII to the Spt6 tandem SH2 is more extensive than the mere recognition of a doubly phosphorylated C-terminal domain peptide by the tandem SH2. Taken together, our results show that Spt6 interaction with RNAPII via a novel arrangement of canonical and noncanonical SH2 domains is crucial for Spt6 function in vivo.},

In this study, we determined the solution structure of the C-terminal region of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt6, and we discovered that Spt6 has two SH2 domains in tandem. Structural and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the second SH2 domain was evolutionarily distant from canonical SH2 domains and represented a novel SH2 subfamily with a novel binding site for phosphoserine. In addition, NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments demonstrated that the tandem SH2 domains recognized Tyr1, Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 phosphorylation of RNAPII CTD with millimolar binding affinities. The structural basis for the binding of the tandem SH2 domains to different forms of phosphorylated RNAPII CTD and its physiological relevance are discussed. Our results also suggest that Spt6 may use the tandem SH2 domain module to sense the phosphorylation level of RNAPII CTD.},

Crystal structures showed that pT1471 binds the canonical SH2 pY site while pS1493 binds an unanticipated pocket 70 Å distant. Remarkably, the pT1471 phosphate occupies the phosphate-binding site of a canonical pY complex, while Y1473 occupies the position of a canonical pY side chain, with the combination of pT and Y mimicking a pY moiety. Biochemical data and modeling indicate that pY1473 can form an equivalent interaction, and we find that pT1471/pS1493 and pY1473/pS1493 combinations occur in vivo.

The tandem SH2 domain binds to a serine 2-phosphorylated CTD peptide in vitro, whereas its N-terminal SH2 subdomain, which we previously characterized, does not. CTD binding requires a positively charged crevice in the C-terminal SH2 subdomain, which lacks the canonical phospho-binding pocket of SH2 domains and had previously escaped detection. The tandem SH2 domain is apparently required for transcription elongation in vivo as its deletion in cells is lethal in the presence of 6-azauracil.},

	abstract ={Spt6 promotes transcription elongation at many genes and functions as a histone H3 chaperone to alter chromatin structure during transcription. We show here that mammalian Spt6 binds Ser2-phosphorylated (Ser2P) RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) through a primitive SH2 domain, which recognizes phosphoserine rather than phosphotyrosine residues. Surprisingly, a point mutation in the Spt6 SH2 domain (R1358K) blocked binding to RNAPIIo without affecting transcription elongation rates in vitro. However, HIV-1 and c-myc RNAs formed in cells expressing the mutant Spt6 protein were longer than normal and contained splicing defects. Ectopic expression of the wild-type, but not mutant, Spt6 SH2 domain, caused bulk poly(A)+ RNAs to be retained in the nucleus, further suggesting a widespread role for Spt6 in mRNA processing or assembly of export-competent mRNP particles. We cloned the human Spt6-interacting protein, hIws1 (interacts with Spt6), and found that it associates with the nuclear RNA export factor, REF1/Aly. Depletion of endogenous hIws1 resulted in mRNA processing defects, lower levels of REF1/Aly at the c-myc gene, and nuclear retention of bulk HeLa poly(A)+ RNAs in vivo. Thus binding of Spt6 to Ser2-P RNAPII provides a cotranscriptional mechanism to recruit Iws1, REF1/Aly, and associated mRNA processing, surveillance, and export factors to responsive genes.},

	abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt6 protein is a conserved chromatin factor with several distinct functional domains, including a natively unstructured 30-residue N-terminal region that binds competitively with Spn1 or nucleosomes. To uncover physiological roles of these interactions, we isolated histone mutations that suppress defects caused by weakening Spt6:Spn1 binding with the spt6-F249K mutation. The strongest suppressor was H2A-N39K, which perturbs the point of contact between the two H2A-H2B dimers in an assembled nucleosome. Substantial suppression also was observed when the H2A-H2B interface with H3-H4 was altered, and many members of this class of mutations also suppressed a defect in another essential histone chaperone, FACT. Spt6 is best known as an H3-H4 chaperone, but we found that it binds with similar affinity to H2A-H2B or H3-H4. Like FACT, Spt6 is therefore capable of binding each of the individual components of a nucleosome, but unlike FACT, Spt6 did not produce endonuclease-sensitive reorganized nucleosomes and did not displace H2A-H2B dimers from nucleosomes. Spt6 and FACT therefore have distinct activities, but defects can be suppressed by overlapping histone mutations. We also found that Spt6 and FACT together are nearly as abundant as nucleosomes, with \~{}24,000 Spt6 molecules, \~{}42,000 FACT molecules, and \~{}75,000 nucleosomes per cell. Histone mutations that destabilize interfaces within nucleosomes therefore reveal multiple spatial regions that have both common and distinct roles in the functions of these two essential and abundant histone chaperones. We discuss these observations in terms of different potential roles for chaperones in both promoting the assembly of nucleosomes and monitoring their quality.},

The first subdomain (one HEAT repeat; HEAT subdomain) is a putative phosphoprotein-binding site most likely involved in an Spt6-independent function of Iws1. The second subdomain (two ARM repeats; ARM subdomain) specifically recognizes a bipartite N-terminal region of Spt6. Mutations that alter this region of Spt6 cause severe phenotypes in vivo. Importantly, the ARM subdomain of Iws1 is conserved in several transcription factors, including TFIIS, Elongin A and Med26. We show that the homologous region in yeast TFIIS enables this factor to interact with SAGA and the Mediator subunits Spt8 and Med13, suggesting the molecular basis for TFIIS recruitment at promoters.

Costaining with antibodies to Spt6 and to either the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II or cyclin T, a subunit of the elongation factor P-TEFb, reveals that all three factors have a similar distribution at sites of active transcription. Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation experiments show that Spt5 is present at uninduced heat shock gene promoters, and that upon heat shock, Spt5 and Spt6 associate with the 5′ and 3′ ends of heat shock genes. Spt6 is recruited within 2 minutes of a heat shock, similar to heat shock factor (HSF); moreover, this recruitment is dependent on HSF. These findings provide support for the roles of Spt5 in promoter-associated pausing and of Spt5 and Spt6 in transcriptional elongation in vivo.},

	abstract ={Spt6 is a highly conserved factor required for normal transcription and chromatin structure. To gain new insights into the roles of Spt6, we measured nucleosome occupancy along Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III in an spt6 mutant. We found that the level of nucleosomes is greatly reduced across some, but not all, coding regions in an spt6 mutant, with nucleosome loss preferentially occurring over highly transcribed genes. This result provides strong support for recent studies that have suggested that transcription at low levels does not displace nucleosomes, while transcription at high levels does, and adds the idea that Spt6 is required for restoration of nucleosomes at the highly transcribed genes. Unexpectedly, our studies have also suggested that the spt6 effects on nucleosome levels across coding regions do not cause the spt6 effects on mRNA levels, suggesting that the role of Spt6 across coding regions is separate from its role in transcriptional regulation. In the case of the CHA1 gene, regulation by Spt6 likely occurs by controlling the position of the +1 nucleosome. These results, along with previous studies, suggest that Spt6 regulates transcription by controlling chromatin structure over regulatory regions, and its effects on nucleosome levels over coding regions likely serve an independent function.},

To learn more about the function of the Spt4/Spt5 complex and Spt6 in vivo, we have identified Drosophila homologs of Spt5 and Spt6 and characterized their localization onDrosophila polytene chromosomes.

	abstract ={Recent studies have suggested that Spt6 participates in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). However, its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. One possibility, which is supported by genetic and biochemical studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is that Spt6 affects chromatin structure. Alternatively, Spt6 directly controls transcription by binding to the transcription machinery. In this study, we establish that human Spt6 (hSpt6) is a classic transcription elongation factor that enhances the rate of RNAPII elongation. hSpt6 is capable of stimulating transcription elongation both individually and in concert with DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), comprising human Spt5 and human Spt4. We also provide evidence showing that hSpt6 interacts with RNAPII and DSIF in human cells. Thus, in vivo, hSpt6 may regulate multiple steps of mRNA synthesis through its interaction with histones, elongating RNAPII, and possibly other components of the transcription machinery.},

However, none of the tested factors have been shown to directly affect the elongation rate of Pol II in vivo. We performed a directed RNAi knock-down (KD) screen targeting 141 candidate transcription factors and identified multiple factors, including Spt6, that alter the induced Hsp70 transcript levels in Drosophila S2 cells. Spt6 is known to interact with both nucleosome structure and Pol II, and it has properties consistent with having a role in elongation. Here, ChIP assays of the first wave of Pol II after heat shock in S2 cells show that KD of Spt6 reduces the rate of Pol II elongation. Also, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assays of GFP-Pol II in salivary gland cells show that this Spt6-dependent effect on elongation rate persists during steady-state-induced transcription, reducing the elongation rate from \~{}1100 to 500 bp/min. Furthermore, RNAi depletion of Spt6 reveals its broad requirement during different stages of development.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The genome in eukaryotic cells is packaged into nucleosomes, which play critical roles in regulating where and when different genes are expressed. For example, nucleosomes can physically block access of transcription factor to sites on DNA or direct regulatory proteins to DNA. Consistent with these roles, nucleosomes assume a stereotypical pattern around genes: they are depleted at the promoter region that marks the start of genes and assume a regularly spaced array within genes. To identify factors involved in this organization, we generated high-resolution nucleosome and transcriptome maps for 50 loss-of-function mutants with known or suspected roles in nucleosome biology in budding yeast. We show that nucleosome organization is determined by the combined effects of many factors that often exert opposing forces on nucleosomes. We further demonstrate that specific nucleosomes can be positioned independently within genes and that repositioning of nucleosomes at the start of genes may affect expression of these genes in response to environmental stimuli. Data mining of this extensive resource allowed us to show that general transcription factors act as insulators at diverging promoters to prevent the formation of cryptic transcripts, and also revealed 36 novel transcripts regulated by the Tup1/Cyc8 complex.},

	    inhibition occurs via methylation of histone H3 on lysine 36, since a

	abstract ={Many steps in gene expression and mRNA biosynthesis are coupled to transcription elongation and organized through the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We showed recently that Spt6, a transcription elongation factor and histone H3 chaperone, binds to the Ser2P CTD and recruits Iws1 and the REF1/Aly mRNA export adaptor to facilitate mRNA export. Here we show that Iws1 also recruits the HYPB/Setd2 histone methyltransferase to the RNAPII elongation complex and is required for H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) across the transcribed region of the c-Myc, HIV-1, and PABPC1 genes in vivo. Interestingly, knockdown of either Iws1 or HYPB/Setd2 also enhanced H3K27me3 at the 5′ end of the PABPC1 gene, and depletion of Iws1, but not HYPB/Setd2, increased histone acetylation across the coding regions at the HIV-1 and PABPC1 genes in vivo. Knockdown of HYPB/Setd2, like Iws1, induced bulk HeLa poly(A)+ mRNAs to accumulate in the nucleus. In vitro, recombinant Spt6 binds selectively to a stretch of uninterrupted consensus repeats located in the N-terminal half of the CTD and recruits Iws1. Thus Iws1 connects two distinct CTD-binding proteins, Spt6 and HYPB/Setd2, in a megacomplex that affects mRNA export as well as the histone modification state of active genes.},

	abstract ={Set2 (KMT3)-dependent methylation (me) of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36) promotes deacetylation of transcribed chromatin and represses cryptic promoters within genes. Although Set2 is the only methyltransferase (KMTase) for H3K36 in yeast, it is not known if Set2 is regulated or whether the different methylation states at H3K36 are functionally distinct. Here we show that the N-terminal 261 residues of Set2 (Set21-261), containing the SET KMTase domain, are sufficient for H3K36me2, histone deacetylation, and repression of cryptic promoters at STE11. Set2-catalyzed H3K36me2 does not require either Ctk1-dependent phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) or the presence of the phospho-C-terminal domain (CTD) interaction (SRI) domain of Set2. This finding is consistent with a known correlation between H3K36me2 and whether a gene is on or off, but not the level of activity of a gene. By contrast, H3K36me3 requires Spt6, proline 38 on histone H3 (H3P38), the CTD of RNAPII, Ctk1, and the C-terminal SRI domain of Set2. We suggest that the C-terminal region of Set2, in conjunction with the phosphorylated CTD of RNAPII, influences the KMTase activity to promote H3K36me3 during transcription elongation.},

	abstract ={The histone H3 Lys 27 (H3K27) demethylase JMJD3 has been shown to play important roles in transcriptional regulation and cell differentiation. However, the mechanism underlying JMJD3-mediated transcriptional regulation remains incompletely understood. Here we show that JMJD3 is associated with KIAA1718, whose substrates include dimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me2), and proteins involved in transcriptional elongation. JMJD3 and KIAA1718 directly bind to and regulate the expression of a plethora of common target genes in both a demethylase activity-dependent and -independent manner in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. We found that JMJD3 and KIAA1718 collaborate to demethylate trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) on a subset of their target genes, some of which are bivalently marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 and associated with promoter-proximal, paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) before activation. Reduction of either JMJD3 or KIAA1718 diminishes Pol II traveling along the gene bodies of the affected genes while having no effect on the promoter-proximal Pol II. Furthermore, JMJD3 and KIAA1718 also play a role in localizing elongation factors SPT6 and SPT16 to the target genes. Our results support the model whereby JMJD3 activates bivalent gene transcription by demethylating H3K27me3 and promoting transcriptional elongation. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into the mechanisms by which JMJD3 regulates gene expression.},

Here, we report that the histone chaperone Spt6 counteracts H3K27me3, an epigenetic mark deposited by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and associated with transcriptional repression. By regulating proper engagement and function of the H3K27 demethylase KDM6A (UTX), Spt6 effectively promotes H3K27 demethylation, muscle gene expression, and cell differentiation. ChIP-Seq experiments reveal an extensive genome-wide overlap of Spt6, PolII, and KDM6A at transcribed regions that are devoid of H3K27me3. Mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos with reduced Spt6 display increased H3K27me3 and diminished expression of the master regulator MyoD, resulting in myogenic differentiation defects. As a confirmation for an antagonistic relationship between Spt6 and H3K27me3, inhibition of PRC2 permits MyoD re-expression in myogenic cells with reduced Spt6. Our data indicate that, through cooperation with PolII and KDM6A, Spt6 orchestrates removal of H3K27me3, thus controlling developmental gene expression and cell differentiation.There is a Have you seen?

This article focuses on two such factors--the highly conserved histone chaperones Spt6 and FACT--that play critical roles in managing chromatin during the gene transcription process.

Here, we have examined the role of two highly conserved yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) histone chaperones, facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) and Spt6, in regulating transcription. We show that the H3 tail contributes to the recruitment of FACT to coding sequences in a manner dependent on acetylation. We found that deleting a H3 histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 or mutating lysines on the H3 tail impairs FACT recruitment at ADH1 and ARG1 genes. However, deleting the H4 tail or mutating the H4 lysines failed to dampen FACT occupancy in coding regions. Additionally, we show that FACT depletion reduces RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy genome-wide. Spt6 depletion leads to a reduction in Pol II occupancy toward the 3'-end, in a manner dependent on the gene length. Severe transcription and histone-eviction defects were also observed in a strain that was impaired for Spt6 recruitment (spt6Δ202) and depleted of FACT. Importantly, the severity of the defect strongly correlated with wild-type Pol II occupancies at these genes, indicating critical roles for Spt6 and Spt16 in promoting high-level transcription. Collectively, our results show that both FACT and Spt6 are important for transcription globally and may participate during different stages of transcription.},

	abstract = {Spt6 is a conserved factor that controls transcription and chromatin structure across the genome. Although Spt6 is viewed as an elongation factor, spt6 mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae allow elevated levels of transcripts from within coding regions, suggesting that Spt6 also controls initiation. To address the requirements for Spt6 in transcription and chromatin structure, we have combined four genome-wide approaches. Our results demonstrate that Spt6 represses transcription initiation at thousands of intragenic promoters. We characterize these intragenic promoters, and find sequence features conserved with genic promoters. Finally, we show that Spt6 also regulates transcription initiation at most genic promoters and propose a model of initiation-site competition to account for this. Together, our results demonstrate that Spt6 controls the fidelity of transcription initiation throughout the genome and reveal the magnitude of the potential for expressing alternative genetic information via intragenic promoters.},

	abstract = {In cells lacking the histone methyltransferase Set2, initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription occurs inappropriately within the protein-coding regions of genes, rather than being restricted to the proximal promoter. It was previously reported that this “cryptic” transcription occurs preferentially in long genes, and in genes that are infrequently transcribed. Here, we mapped the transcripts produced in an S. cerevisiae strain lacking Set2, and applied rigorous statistical methods to identify sites of cryptic transcription at high resolution. We find that suppression of cryptic transcription occurs independent of gene length or transcriptional frequency. Our conclusions differ with those reported previously because we obtained a higher-resolution dataset, we accounted for the fact that gene length and transcriptional frequency are not independent variables, and we accounted for several ascertainment biases that make cryptic transcription easier to detect in long, infrequently transcribed genes. These new results and conclusions have implications for many commonly used genomic analysis approaches, and for the evolution of high-fidelity RNA polymerase II transcriptional initiation in eukaryotes.},

    abstract ={Transcript leaders (TLs) can have profound effects on mRNA translation and stability. To map TL boundaries genome-wide, we developed TL-sequencing (TL-seq), a technique combining enzymatic capture of m7G-capped mRNA 5′ ends with high-throughput sequencing. TL-seq identified mRNA start sites for the majority of yeast genes and revealed many examples of intragenic TL heterogeneity. Surprisingly, TL-seq identified transcription initiation sites within 6% of protein-coding regions, and these sites were concentrated near the 5′ ends of ORFs. Furthermore, ribosome density analysis showed these truncated mRNAs are translated. Translation-associated TL-seq (TATL-seq), which combines TL-seq with polysome fractionation, enabled annotation of TLs, and simultaneously assayed their function in translation. Using TATL-seq to address relationships between TL features and translation of the downstream ORF, we observed that upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and no other upstream codons, were associated with poor translation and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). We also identified hundreds of genes with very short TLs, and demonstrated that short TLs were associated with poor translation initiation at the annotated start codon and increased initiation at downstream AUGs. This frequently resulted in out-of-frame translation and subsequent termination at premature termination codons, culminating in NMD of the transcript. Unlike previous approaches, our technique enabled observation of alternative TL variants for hundreds of genes and revealed significant differences in translation in genes with distinct TL isoforms. TL-seq and TATL-seq are useful tools for annotation and functional characterization of TLs, and can be applied to any eukaryotic system to investigate TL-mediated regulation of gene expression.},

Our transcription start sites (TSSs) analysis of \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} cells deficient for RNA degradation pathways revealed that about half of the pervasive transcripts are degraded by NMD, which provides a fail-safe mechanism to remove spurious transcripts that escaped degradation in the nucleus. Moreover, we found that the low specificity of RNA polymerase II TSSs selection generates, for 47\% of the expressed genes, NMD-sensitive transcript isoforms carrying uORFs or starting downstream of the ATG START codon. Despite the low abundance of this last category of isoforms, their presence seems to constrain genomic sequences, as suggested by the significant bias against in-frame ATGs specifically found at the beginning of the corresponding genes and reflected by a depletion of methionines in the N-terminus of the encoded proteins.},

Although several algorithms for inferring nucleosome position from a single experimental condition have been available, it remains a challenge to accurately define dynamic nucleosomes associated with environmental changes. Here, we report a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline, DANPOS, explicitly designed for dynamic nucleosome analysis at single-nucleotide resolution. Using both simulated and real nucleosome data, we demonstrated that bias correction in preliminary data processing and optimal statistical testing significantly enhances the functional interpretation of dynamic nucleosomes. The single-nucleotide resolution analysis of DANPOS allows us to detect all three categories of nucleosome dynamics, such as position shift, fuzziness change, and occupancy change, using a uniform statistical framework. Pathway analysis indicates that each category is involved in distinct biological functions. We also analyzed the influence of sequencing depth and suggest that even 200-fold coverage is probably not enough to identify all the dynamic nucleosomes. Finally, based on nucleosome data from the human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we demonstrated that DANPOS is also robust in defining functional dynamic nucleosomes, not only in promoters, but also in distal regulatory regions in the mammalian genome.},

This unit describes such an approach, native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), which reveals the density of RNA polymerase across the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome with single-nucleotide resolution. A procedure for capturing nascent RNA transcripts directly from live cells through their association with the DNA-RNA-RNAP ternary complex is described. A protocol to create DNA libraries from the nascent RNA, allowing the identity and abundance of the 3′ end of purified transcripts to be revealed by next generation sequencing, is also provided. By deep sequencing this DNA library, a quantitative measure of RNAP density with single-nucleotide precision is obtained. The quantitative nature of the NET-seq dataset relies on the high efficiency of many steps in the protocol. The steps that are most critical are described with suggestions for monitoring their success. Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 98:14.4.1-14.4.17. © 2012 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}

The universal conservation of the transcription machinery extends to a single RNAP-associated factor, Spt5 (or NusG in bacteria), which renders RNAP processive and may have arisen early to permit evolution of long genes. Spt5 associates with Spt4 to form the Spt4/5 heterodimer. Here, we present the crystal structure of archaeal Spt4/5 bound to the RNAP clamp domain, which forms one side of the RNAP active centre cleft.

The N-terminal NGN domain of Spt5/NusG closes the RNAP active centre cleft to lock nucleic acids and render the elongation complex stable and processive. The C-terminal KOW1 domain is mobile, but its location is restricted to a region between the RNAP clamp and wall above the RNA exit tunnel, where it may interact with RNA and/or other factors.There is a Have you seen?

    abstract ={Interactions between RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) repeats of RNA polymerase II (Pol2) and elongation factor Spt5 are thought to orchestrate cotranscriptional capping of nascent mRNAs. The crystal structure of a fission yeast GTase•Pol2 CTD complex reveals a unique docking site on the nucleotidyl transferase domain for an 8-amino-acid Pol2 CTD segment, S5PPSYSPTS5P, bracketed by two Ser5-PO4 marks. Analysis of GTase mutations that disrupt the Pol2 CTD interface shows that at least one of the two Ser5-PO4-binding sites is required for cell viability and that each site is important for cell growth at 37°C. Fission yeast GTase binds the Spt5 CTD at a separate docking site in the OB-fold domain that captures the Trp4 residue of the Spt5 nonapeptide repeat T1PAW4NSGSK. A disruptive mutation in the Spt5 CTD-binding site of GTase is synthetically lethal with mutations in the Pol2 CTD-binding site, signifying that the Spt5 and Pol2 CTDs cooperate to recruit capping enzyme in vivo. CTD phosphorylation has opposite effects on the interaction of GTase with Pol2 (Ser5-PO4 is required for binding) versus Spt5 (Thr1-PO4 inhibits binding). We propose that the state of Thr1 phosphorylation comprises a binary “Spt5 CTD code” that is read by capping enzyme independent of and parallel to its response to the state of the Pol2 CTD.},

Fission yeast RNA triphosphatase binds to the Spt5 CTD, comprising a tandem repeat of nonapeptide motif TPAWNSGSK. Here we report the crystal structure of a Pct1·Spt5-CTD complex, which revealed two CTD docking sites on the Pct1 homodimer that engage TPAWN segments of the motif. Each Spt5 CTD interface, composed of elements from both subunits of the homodimer, is dominated by van der Waals contacts from Pct1 to the tryptophan of the CTD. The bound CTD adopts a distinctive conformation in which the peptide backbone makes a tight U-turn so that the proline stacks over the tryptophan. We show that Pct1 binding to Spt5 CTD is antagonized by threonine phosphorylation. Our results fortify an emerging concept of an “Spt5 CTD code” in which (i) the Spt5 CTD is structurally plastic and can adopt different conformations that are templated by particular cellular Spt5 CTD receptor proteins; and (ii) threonine phosphorylation of the Spt5 CTD repeat inscribes a binary on–off switch that is read by diverse CTD receptors, each in its own distinctive manner.},

A crux of this network is Spt5, which regulates early transcription elongation and has an imputed role in pre-mRNA processing via its physical association with capping enzymes. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Spt5 has a distinctive CTD composed of tandem nonapeptide repeats of the consensus sequence 1TPAWNSGSK9. The Spt5 CTD binds the capping enzymes and is a substrate for threonine phosphorylation by the Cdk9 kinase. Here we report that deletion of the S. pombe Spt5 CTD results in slow growth and aberrant cell morphology. The severity of the spt5-ΔCTD phenotype is exacerbated by truncation of the Pol II CTD and ameliorated by overexpression of the capping enzymes RNA triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase. These results suggest that the Spt5 and Pol II CTDs play functionally overlapping roles in capping enzyme recruitment. We probed structure-activity relations of the Spt5 CTD by alanine scanning of the consensus nonapeptide. The T1A change abolished CTD phosphorylation by Cdk9 but did not affect CTD binding to the capping enzymes. The T1A and P2A mutations elicited cold-sensitive (cs) and temperature-sensitive (ts) growth defects and conferred sensitivity to growth inhibition by 6-azauracil that was exacerbated by partial truncations of the Pol II CTD. The T1A phenotypes were rescued by a phosphomimetic T1E change but not by capping enzyme overexpression. These results imply a positive role for Spt5 CTD phosphorylation in Pol Il transcription elongation in fission yeast, distinct from its capping enzyme interactions. Viability of yeast cells bearing both Spt5 CTD T1A and Pol II CTD S2A mutations heralds that the Cdk9 kinase has an essential target other than Spt5 and Pol II CTD-Ser2.},

Deletion of the Spt5 CTD or mutation of the Spt5 serines targeted by Bur1 reduces recruitment of the PAF complex, which functions to recruit factors involved in chromatin modification and mRNA maturation to elongating polymerase II (Pol II). Deletion of the Spt5 CTD showed the same defect in PAF recruitment as rapid inhibition of Bur1 kinase activity, and this Spt5 mutation led to a decrease in histone H3K4 trimethylation. Brief inhibition of Bur1 kinase activity in vivo also led to a significant decrease in phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD at Ser-2, showing that Bur1 also contributes to Pol II Ser-2 phosphorylation.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) enzymes are key positive regulators of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation, and are required for co-transcriptional events such as mRNA processing and chromatin modification. Cdk9 phosphorylates RNAPII and the elongation factor Spt5, but the molecular pathways that underlie Cdk9 functions in transcription remain poorly defined. Using fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model system, we have identified two Cdk9-dependent pathways that modulate RNAPII elongation. One pathway involves the direct interaction of phosphorylated Spt5 with Prf1/Rtf1, a multi-functional transcriptional regulator. A second pathway, involving a different Cdk9 target, directs the Polymerase Associated Factor (PAF) complex to transcribed chromatin. The Prf1 and PAF pathways are functionally distinct and have opposing effects on the RNAPII elongation complex. Our data provide novel insights into Cdk9 functions and suggest that Cdk9 auto-regulatory mechanisms are an important feature of RNAPII elongation.},

This study shows how phosphorylation of a repeated motif within an additional factor, Spt5, is recognized and used by the Plus3 domain within the Paf1C subunit Rtf1 (restores TBP function 1) to promote recruitment of Paf1C to the transcription machinery. Deletions of both the Rtf1 Plus3 domain and the C domain of Cdc73 (Cell Division Cycle 73) are required to abolish Paf1C-mediated histone modifications and chromatin occupancy suggesting that dual attachment points facilitate the association of Paf1C with RNA pol II.Polymerase associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C) broadly influences gene expression by regulating chromatin structure and the recruitment of RNA-processing factors during transcription elongation. The Plus3 domain of the Rtf1 subunit mediates Paf1C recruitment to genes by binding a repeating domain within the elongation factor Spt5 (suppressor of Ty). Here we provide a molecular description of this interaction by reporting the structure of human Rtf1 Plus3 in complex with a phosphorylated Spt5 repeat. We find that Spt5 binding is mediated by an extended surface containing phosphothreonine recognition and hydrophobic interfaces that interact with residues outside the Spt5 motif. Changes within these interfaces diminish binding of Spt5 in vitro and chromatin localization of Rtf1 in vivo. The structure reveals the basis for recognition of the repeat motif of Spt5, a key player in the recruitment of gene regulatory factors to RNA polymerase II.},

        abstract = {Elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is a finely regulated process in which many elongation factors contribute to gene regulation. Among these factors are the polymerase-associated factor (PAF) complex, which associates with RNAPII, and several cyclin-dependent kinases, including positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in humans and BUR kinase (Bur1{\textendash}Bur2) and C-terminal domain (CTD) kinase 1 (CTDK1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An important target of P-TEFb and CTDK1, but not BUR kinase, is the CTD of the Rpb1 subunit of RNAPII. Although the essential BUR kinase phosphorylates Rad6, which is required for histone H2B ubiquitination on K123, Rad6 is not essential, leaving a critical substrate(s) of BUR kinase unidentified. Here we show that BUR kinase is important for the phosphorylation in vivo of Spt5, a subunit of the essential yeast RNAPII elongation factor Spt4/Spt5, whose human orthologue is DRB sensitivity-inducing factor. BUR kinase can also phosphorylate the C-terminal region (CTR) of Spt5 in vitro. Like BUR kinase, the Spt5 CTR is important for promoting elongation by RNAPII and recruiting the PAF complex to transcribed regions. Also like BUR kinase and the PAF complex, the Spt5 CTR is important for histone H2B K123 monoubiquitination and histone H3 K4 and K36 trimethylation during transcription elongation. Our results suggest that the Spt5 CTR, which contains 15 repeats of a hexapeptide whose consensus sequence is S[T/A]WGG[A/Q], is a substrate of BUR kinase and a platform for the association of proteins that promote both transcription elongation and histone modification in transcribed regions.},

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that the Spt5 CTR is required for normal recruitment of pre-mRNA cleavage factor I (CFI) to the 3' ends of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. RNA contributes to CFI recruitment, as RNase treatment prior to ChIP further decreases CFI ChIP signals. Genome-wide ChIP profiling detected occupancy peaks of CFI subunits around 100 nucleotides downstream of the polyadenylation (pA) sites of genes. CFI recruitment to this defined region may result from simultaneous binding to the Spt5 CTR, to nascent RNA containing the pA sequence, and to the elongating Pol II isoform that is phosphorylated at serine 2 (S2) residues in its C-terminal domain (CTD). Consistent with this model, the CTR interacts with CFI in vitro but is not required for pA site recognition and transcription termination in vivo.},

        abstract = {Author Summary Acetylation of histone N-terminal tails occurs on nucleosomes as a gene is being transcribed, therefore helping the RNA polymerase II traveling through nucleosomes. Histone acetylation, however, has to be reversed in the wake of the polymerase in order to prevent transcription from initiating at the wrong place. Rpd3S is a histone deacetylase complex recruited to transcribed genes to fulfill this function. The Rpd3S complex contains a chromodomain that is thought to be responsible for the association of Rpd3S with genes since it interacts with methylated histones, a feature found on transcribed genes. Here, we show that the recruitment of Rpd3S to transcribed genes does not require histone methylation. We found that Rpd3S is actually recruited by a mechanism implicating the phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain and that this mechanism is regulated by a transcriptional elongation complex called DSIF. We propose that the interaction between the Rpd3S chromodomain and methylated histones helps anchoring the deacetylase to its substrate only after it has been recruited to the elongating RNA polymerase.},

        abstract = {Kar4p is a transcription factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is required for the expression of karyogamy-specific genes during mating, for the efficient transit from G1 during mitosis, and for essential functions during meiosis. Kar4p exists in two forms: a constitutive slower-migrating form, which predominates during vegetative growth, and a faster-migrating form, which is highly induced by mating pheromone. Transcript mapping of KAR4 revealed that the constitutive mRNA was initiated upstream of two in-frame ATG initiation codons, while the major inducible mRNA originated between them. Thus, the two forms of Kar4p are derived from the translation of alternative transcripts, which possess different AUG initiation codons. Site-directed mutations were constructed to inactivate one or the other of the initiation codons, allowing the expression of the two Kar4p forms separately. At normal levels of expression, the constitutive form of Kar4p did not support wild-type levels of mating. However, the two forms of Kar4p could also be expressed separately from the regulatableGAL1 promoter, and no functional difference was detected when they were expressed at equivalent levels. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the induced form of Kar4p was highly expressed and stable during mating but rapidly turned over in vegetative cells. In contrast, the constitutively expressed longer form showed the same rate of turnover regardless of the growth condition. Furthermore, overexpression of either form of Kar4p in vegetative cells was toxic. Thus, the elaborate regulation of the two forms of Kar4p at the levels of transcription, translation, and protein turnover reflects the requirement for high levels of the protein during mating and for low levels during the subsequent phases of the cell cycle.},

    abstract={We have sequenced and annotated the genome of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), which contains the smallest number of protein-coding genes yet recorded for a eukaryote: 4,824. The centromeres are between 35 and 110 kilobases (kb) and contain related repeats including a highly conserved 1.8-kb element. Regions upstream of genes are longer than in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), possibly reflecting more-extended control regions. Some 43\% of the genes contain introns, of which there are 4,730. Fifty genes have significant similarity with human disease genes; half of these are cancer related. We identify highly conserved genes important for eukaryotic cell organization including those required for the cytoskeleton, compartmentation, cell-cycle control, proteolysis, protein phosphorylation and RNA splicing. These genes may have originated with the appearance of eukaryotic life. Few similarly conserved genes that are important for multicellular organization were identified, suggesting that the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes required more new genes than did the transition from unicellular to multicellular organization.},

        Epigenomic profiling by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a prevailing methodology used to investigate chromatin-based regulation in biological systems such as human disease, but the lack of an empirical methodology to enable normalization among experiments has limited the precision and usefulness of this technique. Here, we describe a method called ChIP with reference exogenous genome (ChIP-Rx) that allows one to perform genome-wide quantitative comparisons of histone modification status across cell populations using defined quantities of a reference epigenome. ChIP-Rx enables the discovery and quantification of dynamic epigenomic profiles across mammalian cells that would otherwise remain hidden using traditional normalization methods. We demonstrate the utility of this method for measuring epigenomic changes following chemical perturbations and show how reference normalization of ChIP-seq experiments enables the discovery of disease-relevant changes in histone modification occupancy."

    abstract ={Previous characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeSpt4, Spt5, and Spt6 proteins suggested that these proteins act as transcription factors that modify chromatin structure. In this work, we report new genetic and biochemical studies of Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 that reveal a role for these factors in transcription elongation. We have isolated conditional mutations in SPT5 that can be suppressed in an allele-specific manner by mutations in the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Strikingly, one of these RNA Pol II mutants is defective for transcription elongation and the others cause phenotypes consistent with an elongation defect. In addition, we show that spt4, spt5, and spt6 mutants themselves have phenotypes suggesting defects in transcription elongation in vivo. Consistent with these findings, we show that Spt5 is physically associated with RNA Pol II in vivo, and have identified a region of sequence similarity between Spt5 and NusG, an Escherichia colitranscription elongation factor that binds directly to RNA polymerase. Finally, we show that Spt4 and Spt5 are tightly associated in a complex that does not contain Spt6. These results, taken together with the biochemical identification of a human Spt4–Spt5 complex as a transcription elongation factor (Wada et al. 1998), provide strong evidence that these factors are important for transcription elongation in vivo.},

    abstract ={The Spt5-Spt4 complex regulates early transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II and has an imputed role in pre-mRNA processing via its physical association with mRNA capping enzymes. Here we characterize the Schizosaccharomyces pombe core Spt5-Spt4 complex as a heterodimer and map a trypsin-resistant Spt4-binding domain within the Spt5 subunit. A genetic analysis of Spt4 in S. pombe revealed it to be inessential for growth at 25°C–30°C but critical at 37°C. These results echo the conditional spt4Δ growth phenotype in budding yeast, where we find that Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. pombe Spt4 are functionally interchangeable. Complementation of S. cerevisiae spt4Δ and a two-hybrid assay for Spt4-Spt5 interaction provided a readout of the effects of 33 missense and truncation mutations on S. pombe Spt4 function in vivo, which were interpreted in light of the recent crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Spt4 fused to a fragment of Spt5. Our results highlight the importance of the Spt4 Zn2+-binding residues—Cys12, Cys15, Cys29, and Asp32—and of Ser57, a conserved constituent of the Spt4-Spt5 interface. The 990-amino acid S. pombe Spt5 protein has an exceptionally regular carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) composed of 18 nonapeptide repeats. We find that as few as three nonamer repeats sufficed for S. pombe growth, but only when Spt4 was present. Synthetic lethality of the spt51-835 spt4Δ double mutant at 34°C suggests that interaction of Spt4 with the central domain of Spt5 overlaps functionally with the Spt5 CTD.},

    abstract ={We report the identification of a transcription elongation factor from HeLa cell nuclear extracts that causes pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in conjunction with the transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB). This factor, termed DRBsensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), is also required for transcription inhibition by H8. DSIF has been purified and is composed of 160-kD (p160) and 14-kD (p14) subunits. Isolation of a cDNA encoding DSIF p160 shows it to be a homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Spt5. Recombinant Supt4h protein, the human homolog of yeast Spt4, is functionally equivalent to DSIF p14, indicating that DSIF is composed of the human homologs of Spt4 and Spt5. In addition to its negative role in elongation, DSIF is able to stimulate the rate of elongation by RNA Pol II in a reaction containing limiting concentrations of ribonucleoside triphosphates. A role for DSIF in transcription elongation is further supported by the fact that p160 has a region homologous to the bacterial elongation factor NusG. The combination of biochemical studies on DSIF and genetic analysis of Spt4 and Spt5 in yeast, also in this issue, indicates that DSIF associates with RNA Pol II and regulates its processivity in vitro and in vivo.},

    abstract = {Abstract The heterodimeric transcription elongation factor Spt4/Spt5 (Spt4/5) tightly associates with RNAPII to regulate both transcriptional elongation and co-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing; however, the mechanisms by which Spt4/5 acts are poorly understood. Recent studies of the human and Drosophila Spt4/5 complexes indicate that they can bind nucleic acids in vitro. We demonstrate here that yeast Spt4/5 can bind in a sequence-specific manner to single stranded RNA containing AAN repeats. Furthermore, we show that the major protein determinants for RNA-binding are Spt4 together with the NGN domain of Spt5 and that the KOW domains are not required for RNA recognition. These findings attribute a new function to a domain of Spt4/5 that associates directly with RNAPII, making significant steps towards elucidating the mechanism behind transcriptional control by Spt4/5.},

    abstract ={RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) undergoes structural changes during the transitions from initiation, elongation, and termination, which are aided by a collection of proteins called elongation factors. NusG/Spt5 is the only elongation factor conserved in all domains of life. Although much information exists about the interactions between NusG/Spt5 and RNA polymerase in prokaryotes, little is known about how the binding of eukaryotic Spt4/5 affects the biochemical activities of RNAPII. We characterized the activities of Spt4/5 and interrogated the structural features of Spt5 required for it to interact with elongation complexes, bind nucleic acids, and promote transcription elongation. The eukaryotic specific regions of Spt5 containing the Kyrpides, Ouzounis, Woese domains are involved in stabilizing the association with the RNAPII elongation complex, which also requires the presence of the nascent transcript. Interestingly, we identify a region within the conserved NusG N-terminal (NGN) domain of Spt5 that contacts the non-template strand of DNA both upstream of RNAPII and in the transcription bubble. Mutating charged residues in this region of Spt5 did not prevent Spt4/5 binding to elongation complexes, but abrogated the cross-linking of Spt5 to DNA and the anti-arrest properties of Spt4/5, thus suggesting that contact between Spt5 (NGN) and DNA is required for Spt4/5 to promote elongation. We propose that the mechanism of how Spt5/NGN promotes elongation is fundamentally conserved; however, the eukaryotic specific regions of the protein evolved so that it can serve as a platform for other elongation factors and maintain its association with RNAPII as it navigates genomes packaged into chromatin.},

Extensive genetic and functional data have revealed diverse roles of Spt4-Spt5 in coupling elongation with chromatin modification and RNA-processing pathways. A mechanistic understanding of the diverse functions of Spt4-Spt5 is hampered by challenges in resolving the distribution of functions among its structural domains, including the five KOW domains in Spt5, and a lack of their high-resolution structures. We present high-resolution crystallographic results demonstrating that distinct structures are formed by the first through third KOW domains (KOW1-Linker1 [K1L1] and KOW2-KOW3) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt5. The structure reveals that K1L1 displays a positively charged patch (PCP) on its surface, which binds nucleic acids in vitro, as shown in biochemical assays, and is important for in vivo function, as shown in growth assays. Furthermore, assays in yeast have shown that the PCP has a function that partially overlaps that of Spt4. Synthesis of our results with previous evidence suggests a model in which Spt4 and the K1L1 domain of Spt5 form functionally overlapping interactions with nucleic acids upstream of the transcription bubble, and this mechanism may confer robustness on processes associated with transcription elongation.},

    abstract ={Spt5 is a transcription factor conserved in all three kingdoms of life. Spt5 homologues from bacteria and archaea bind the largest subunit of their respective RNA polymerases. Here we demonstrate that Spt5 directly associates with RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in yeast through its central region containing conserved NGN and KOW domains. Deletion analysis of SPT5 supports our biochemical data, demonstrating the importance of the KOW domains in Spt5 function. Far Western blot analysis implicates A190 of Pol I as well as Rpb1 of Pol II in binding Spt5. Three additional subunits of Pol I may also participate in this interaction. One of these subunits, A49, has known roles in transcription elongation by Pol I. Interestingly, spt5 truncation mutations suppress the cold-sensitive phenotype of rpa49∆ strain which lacks the A49 subunit in the Pol I complex. Finally, we observed that Spt5 directly binds to an essential Pol I transcription initiation factor, Rrn3, and to the ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Based on these data we propose a model in which Spt5 is recruited to the rDNA early in transcription, and that it plays an important role in rRNA synthesis through direct binding to the Pol I complex.},

DSIF is composed of 160- and 14-kDa subunits, which are homologs of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factors Spt5 and Spt4. DSIF may either repress or stimulate transcription in vitro, depending on conditions, but its physiological function remains elusive. Here we characterize the structure and function of DSIF p160. p160 is shown to be a ubiquitous nuclear protein that forms a stable complex with p14 and interacts directly with the pol II largest subunit. Mutation analysis of p160 is used to identify structural features essential for its in vitro activity and to map the domains required for its interaction with p14 and pol II. Finally, a p160 mutant that represses DSIF activity in a dominant-negative manner is identified and used to demonstrate that DSIF represses transcription from various promoters in vivo.},

DSIF is also reportedly involved in transcriptional activation. However, the role of DSIF in transcriptional activation by DNA-binding activators is unclear. Here we show that DSIF acts cooperatively with a DNA-binding activator, Gal4-VP16, to promote transcriptional activation. In the absence of DSIF, Gal4-VP16-activated transcription resulted in frequent pausing of RNAPII during elongation in vitro. The presence of DSIF reduced pausing, thereby supporting Gal4-VP16-mediated activation. We found that DSIF exerts its positive effects within a short time-frame from initiation to elongation, and that NELF does not affect the positive regulatory function of DSIF. Knockdown of the gene encoding the large subunit of DSIF, human Spt5 (hSpt5), in HeLa cells reduced Gal4-VP16-mediated activation of a reporter gene, but had no effect on expression in the absence of activator. Together, these results provide evidence that higher-level transcription has a stronger requirement for DSIF, and that DSIF contributes to efficient transcriptional activation by preventing RNAPII pausing during transcription elongation.}",

The sense and antisense transcripts are also translated into dipeptide repeat proteins, which are aggregation-prone and accumulate in the brain and spinal cord. Last, loss of function from reduced expression of C9orf72 in neurons and glia could contribute to the disease.

        A number of proteins and drugs have been implicated in the process of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II, but the factors that govern the elongation rate (nucleotide additions per min) and processivity (nucleotide additions per initiation event) in vivo are poorly understood. Here, we show that a mutation in the Rpb2 subunit of Pol II reduces both the elongation rate and processivity in vivo. In contrast, none of the putative elongation factors tested affect the elongation rate, although mutations in the THO complex and in Spt4 significantly reduce processivity. The drugs 6-azauracil and mycophenolic acid reduce both the elongation rate and processivity, and this processivity defect is aggravated by mutations in Spt4, TFIIS, and CTDK-1. Our results suggest that, in vivo, a reduced rate of Pol II elongation leads to premature dissociation along the chromatin template and that Pol II processivity can be uncoupled from elongation rate."

The Isw1a complex (Iswlp/Ioc3p) represses gene expression at initiation through specific positioning of a promoter proximal dinucleosome, whereas the Isw1b complex (Iswlp/Ioc2p/Ioc4p) acts within coding regions to control the amount of RNA polymerase (RNAPII) released into productive elongation and to coordinate elongation with termination and pre-mRNA processing. These effects of Isw1b are controlled via phosphorylation of the heptad repeat carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII and methylation of the chromatin template. The transcription elongation factor Spt4p antagonizes Isw1p and overcomes the Isw1p dependent pausing of RNAPII at the onset of the elongation cycle. Overall these studies establish the central role played by Isw1p in the coordination of transcription."

Here, we show that this suppression of spt5 can result from loss of histone H3 lysines 4 or 36 methylation, or reduced recruitment of Chd1 or the Rpd3S complex. These spt5 suppressors also rescue the synthetic growth defects observed in spt5 mutants that also lack elongation factor TFIIS. Using a FLO8 reporter gene, we found that a chd1 mutation caused cryptic initiation of transcription. We further observed enhancement of cryptic initiation in chd1 isw1 mutants and increased histone acetylation in a chd1 mutant.

We found that spt4Δ, like THO mutants, impaired transcription of lacZ and of long and GC-rich DNA sequences fused to the GAL1 promoter. Using a newly developed in vitro transcription elongation assay, we show that Spt4 is required in elongation. There is a functional interaction between Spt4 and THO, detected by the lethality or strong gene expression defect and hyper-recombination phenotypes of double mutants in the W303 genetic background. Our results indicate that Spt4{\textendash}Spt5 has a positive role in transcription elongation and suggest that Spt4{\textendash}Spt5 and THO act at different steps during mRNA biogenesis.},

Here, we examined the global effects of the elongation factor Spt5 on nascent and mature mRNAs of TNF-α-induced cells using chromatin and cytosolic subcellular fractions. We identified several classes of TNF-α-induced genes controlled at the level of transcription, splicing, and chromatin retention. Spt5 was found to facilitate splicing and chromatin release in genes displaying high induction rates. Further analysis revealed striking effects of TNF-α on the splicing of 25\% of expressed genes; the vast majority were not transcriptionally induced. Splicing enhancement of noninduced genes by TNF-α was transient and independent of NF-κB. Investigating the underlying basis, we found that Spt5 is required for the splicing facilitation of the noninduced genes. In line with this, Spt5 interacts with Sm core protein splicing factors. Furthermore, following TNF-α treatment, levels of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) but not Spt5 are reduced from the splicing-induced genes, suggesting that these genes become enriched with a Pol II-Spt5 form. Our findings revealed the Pol II-Spt5 complex as a highly competent coordinator of cotranscriptional splicing.},

Previous biochemical studies have shown that DSIF positively and negatively regulates RNA polymerase II elongation in collaboration with other protein factors. While several data suggest that DSIF is a ‘general’ elongation factor, there is also evidence that DSIF exerts a tissue- and gene-specific function. Here we sought to address the question of whether physiological functions of DSIF are general or specific, by using a sophisticated knockdown approach and gene expression microarray analysis. We found that Spt5 is essential for cell growth of various human cell lines and that Spt5 knockdown causes senescence and apoptosis. However, Spt5 knockdown affects a surprisingly small number of genes. In Spt5 knockdown cells, the p53 signaling pathway is activated and mediates part of the knockdown-induced transcriptional change, but apoptotic cell death occurs in the absence of p53. Structure-function analysis of Spt5 shows that the C-terminal approximately 300 amino acid residues are not required to support cell proliferation. These results suggest that one of the functions of Spt5 is to suppress senescence and apoptosis, and that this function is exerted through its association with Spt4 and Pol II.},

Here, we identify direct target genes of Spt5 using fogsk8 zebrafish mutant, which disrupts the foggy/spt5 gene. We identified that fogsk8 and their wildtype siblings differentially express less than 5% of genes examined. These genes participate in diverse biological processes from stress response to cell fate specification. Up-regulated genes exhibit shorter overall gene length compared to all genes examined. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation in zebrafish embryos, we identified a subset of developmentally critical genes that are bound by both Spt5 and RNA polymerase II. The protein occupancy patterns on these genes are characteristic of both repressive and stimulatory elongation regulation. Together our findings establish Spt5 as a dual regulator of transcription elongation in vivo and identify a small but diverse set of target genes critically dependent on Spt5 during development.},

CSR mechanism involves the orchestrated steps of transcription, DNA break, and repair of the target loci. Within the cells, these processes occur at the chromatin level—involving DNA, histones, and their associated post-translational modifications (PTMs). Transcription factors associated with RNA Polymerase II complex often have regulatory roles in chromatin maintenance, which in turn might regulate the process of DNA cleavage and repair. Here we report that the transcription factor DSIF complex (Spt4 and Spt5) is critically required for CSR. The absence of either Spt4 or Spt5 blocked CSR. Interestingly, Spt4 and Spt5, although previously thought to work as a complex, can function independently of each other at several nodes of CSR, namely transcription regulation, DNA break formation, and histone PTM maintenance, exemplified by H3K4me3. The importance of H3K4me3 unifies three programmed recombinations—CSR, VDJ, and meiotic—in their reliance on this modification for their respective DNA cleavage formations. Moreover, Spt4 and Spt5 are required for DNA repair, another critical aspect of CSR, suggesting that the DNA repair steps of CSR may be coupled with transcription.},

    abstract ={The activities of several mRNA processing factors are coupled to transcription through binding to RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The largest subunit of Pol II contains a repetitive carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) that becomes highly phosphorylated during transcription. mRNA-capping enzyme binds only to phosphorylated CTD, whereas other processing factors may bind to both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms. Capping occurs soon after transcription initiation and before other processing events, raising the question of whether capping components remain associated with the transcription complex after they have modified the 5′ end of the mRNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that capping enzyme cross-links to promoters but not coding regions. In contrast, the mRNA cap methyltransferase and the Hrp1/CFIB polyadenylation factor cross-link to both promoter and coding regions. Remarkably, the phosphorylation pattern of the CTD changes during transcription. Ser 5 phosphorylation is detected primarily at promoter regions dependent on TFIIH. In contrast, Ser 2 phosphorylation is seen only in coding regions. These results suggest a dynamic association of mRNA processing factors with differently modified forms of the polymerase throughout the transcription cycle.},

RPB2 and SPT5 defects also promoted the utilization of upstream poly(A) sites for genes that contain multiple 3' poly(A) signaling sequences, supporting a role for elongation in differential poly(A) site choice. Our data suggest that elongation defects cause increased transcriptional pausing or arrest that results in increased utilization of internal or upstream poly(A) sites. Transcriptional pausing or arrest can therefore be visualized in vivo if a gene contains internal poly(A) sites, allowing biochemical and genetic study of the elongation process.},

    abstract = "Summary
        The MYC oncoprotein binds to promoter-proximal regions of virtually all transcribed genes and enhances RNA polymerase II (Pol II) function, but its precise mode of action is poorly understood. Using mass spectrometry of both MYC and Pol II complexes, we show here that MYC controls the assembly of Pol II with a small set of transcription elongation factors that includes SPT5, a subunit of the elongation factor DSIF. MYC directly binds SPT5, recruits SPT5 to promoters, and enables the CDK7-dependent transfer of SPT5 onto Pol II. Consistent with known functions of SPT5, MYC is required for fast and processive transcription elongation. Intriguingly, the high levels of MYC that are expressed in tumors sequester SPT5 into non-functional complexes, thereby decreasing the expression of growth-suppressive genes. Altogether, these results argue that MYC controls the productive assembly of processive Pol II elongation complexes and provide insight into how oncogenic levels of MYC permit uncontrolled cellular growth."

In this review, we examine a diverse set of recent studies from various organisms that build on foundational studies in budding yeast. These studies identify new roles for Paf1C in the control of gene expression and the regulation of chromatin structure. In exploring these advances, we find that various functions of Paf1C, such as the regulation of promoter-proximal pausing and development in higher eukaryotes, are complex and context dependent. As more becomes known about the role of Paf1C in human disease, interest in the molecular mechanisms underpinning Paf1C function will continue to increase."

    abstract = {Spt5 is a highly conserved RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated pausing and elongation factor. However, its impact on global elongation and Pol II processivity in mammalian cells has not been clarified. Here, we show that depleting Spt5 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) does not cause global elongation defects or decreased elongation rates. Instead, in Spt5-depleted cells, a fraction of Pol II molecules are dislodged during elongation, thus decreasing the number of Pol II complexes that complete the transcription cycle. Most strikingly, this decrease is restricted to a narrow window between 15 and 20~kb from the promoter, a distance which coincides with the stage where accelerating Pol II attains maximum elongation speed. Consequently, long genes show a greater dependency on Spt5 for optimal elongation efficiency and overall gene expression than short genes. We propose that an important role of Spt5 in mammalian elongation is to promote the processivity of those Pol II complexes that are transitioning toward maximum elongation speed 15{\textendash}20~kb from the promoter.The EMBO Journal (2018) e97965},

    abstract ={Regulation by gene-distal enhancers is critical for cell type-specific and condition-specific patterns of gene expression. Thus, to understand the basis of gene activity in a given cell type or tissue, we must identify the precise locations of enhancers and functionally characterize their behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that transcription is a nearly universal feature of enhancers in Drosophila and mammalian cells and that nascent RNA sequencing strategies are optimal for identification of both enhancers and superenhancers. We dissect the mechanisms governing enhancer transcription and discover remarkable similarities to transcription at protein-coding genes. We show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) undergoes regulated pausing and release at enhancers. However, as compared with mRNA genes, RNAPII at enhancers is less stable and more prone to early termination. Furthermore, we found that the level of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) methylation at enhancers corresponds to transcriptional activity such that highly active enhancers display H3K4 trimethylation rather than the H3K4 monomethylation considered a hallmark of enhancers. Finally, our work provides insights into the unique characteristics of superenhancers, which stimulate high-level gene expression through rapid pause release; interestingly, this property renders associated genes resistant to the loss of factors that stabilize paused RNAPII.},

        SUPT4H1 is a transcription elongation factor that makes up part of the RNA polymerase II complex. Recent studies propose a selective role for SUPT4H1 in the transcription of repeat-containing DNA, the translated products of which contribute to neurodegenerative disorders such as C9orf72-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To investigate the potential of SUPT4H1 as a therapeutic target in repeat-associated neurodegeneration, we depleted SUPT4H1 by RNA interference to inhibit the function of the SUPT4H1/SUPT5H transcription elongation complex. Depletion of SUPT4H1 leads to a global reduction in all cellular RNA, highlighting the significant challenges that are associated with targeting this molecule for the treatment of human disease. Any requirement of SUPT4H1 for transcription of specific transcripts should be interpreted in the context of global modulatory effects on the transcriptome."

    abstract = "The nmt1 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is highly expressed and subject to transcriptional repression by thiamine. The nmt1 promoter, in common with other strong promoters in this organism, contains a canonical sequence element, 5′-ATATATAAA, located 25 bp upstream from the transcription start point (tsp). We have made stepwise deletions of the TATA box and quantitated the effects of the mutations by assaying the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-encoding gene (cat) cloned downstream. Our results demonstrate that progressive truncation of the TATA box results in a concomitant decrease in promoter strength as judged both by the loss of CAT activity in cell extracts and by a reduction in the steady-state level of cat mRNA. Both the induced level and the residual, repressed level of expression observed in the presence of thiamine are similarly down-regulated. On the other hand, even in the most extreme mutant, the tsp is unaffected, suggesting that other elements in the nmt1 promoter are important in determination of the tsp. The properties of the modified promoters have made them useful for extending the range of the pREP inducible expression vectors."
